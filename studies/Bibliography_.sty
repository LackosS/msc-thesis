abstract = {Methods for automatically identifying students in need of assistance have been studied for decades. Initially, the work was based on somewhat static factors such as students' educational background and results from various questionnaires, while more recently, constantly accumulating data such as progress with course assignments and behavior in lectures has gained attention. We contribute to this work with results on early detection of students in need of assistance, and provide a starting point for using machine learning techniques on naturally accumulating programming process data.When combining source code snapshot data that is recorded from students' programming process with machine learning methods, we are able to detect high- and low-performing students with high accuracy already after the very first week of an introductory programming course. Comparison of our results to the prominent methods for predicting students' performance using source code snapshot data is also provided.This early information on students' performance is beneficial from multiple viewpoints. Instructors can target their guidance to struggling students early on, and provide more challenging assignments for high-performing students. Moreover, students that perform poorly in the introductory programming course, but who nevertheless pass, can be monitored more closely in their future studies.},

Similarly, we employed data mining techniques such as ID3 &amp;amp; J48 Decision Tree Algorithms to analyze these data. We compared these algorithms on 239 classification instances. The experimental results show that the J48 algorithm has higher accuracy in the classification task compared to the ID3 algorithm. The important feature attributes such as Information Gain and Gain Ratio feature evaluators were also compared. Both the methods applied were able to rank search method and the experimental results confirmed that the two methods derived the same set of attributes with a slight deviation in the ranking. From the results analyzed, we discovered that 67.36 percent failed the course titled Introduction to Computer Programming, while 32.64 percent passed the course. Since the CATT has the highest gain value from our analysis; we concluded that it is largely responsible for the success or failure of the students.}, number={02}, journal={International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET)}, author={Sunday, Kissinger and Ocheja, Patrick and Hussain, Sadiq and Oyelere, Solomon Sunday and Samson, Balogun Oluwafemi and Agbo, Friday Joseph}, year={2020}, month={Jan.}, pages={pp. 127–144} }

ABSTRACT = {Student performance predictive analysis has played a vital role in education in recent years. It allows for the understanding students’ learning behaviours, the identification of at-risk students, and the development of insights into teaching and learning improvement. Recently, many researchers have used data collected from Learning Management Systems to predict student performance. This study investigates the potential of clickstream data for this purpose. A total of 5341 sample students and their click behaviour data from the OULAD (Open University Learning Analytics Dataset) are used. The raw clickstream data are transformed, integrating the time and activity dimensions of students’ click actions. Two feature sets are extracted, indicating the number of clicks on 12 learning sites based on weekly and monthly time intervals. For both feature sets, the experiments are performed to compare deep learning algorithms (including LSTM and 1D-CNN) with traditional machine learning approaches. It is found that the LSTM algorithm outperformed other approaches on a range of evaluation metrics, with up to 90.25% accuracy. Four out of twelve learning sites (content, subpage, homepage, quiz) are identified as critical in influencing student performance in the course. The insights from these critical learning sites can inform the design of future courses and teaching interventions to support at-risk students.},

  abstract = {Due to the growing demand for information technology skills, programming education has received increasing attention. Predicting students’ programming performance helps teachers realize their teaching effect and students’ learning status in time to provide support for students. However, few of the existing researches have taken the code that students wrote into consideration. In fact, code is informative and contains lots of attributes. Student programming performance can be better understood and predicted by adding code information into student profiles. This paper proposed a student profiles model to describe students’ characteristics, which contains the code information and then was used as the input of a deep neural network to predict the programming performance. By comparing different machine learning techniques and different combinations of dimensions of student profiles, the experimental results show that a four-layer deep neural network fed with all available dimensions of student profiles has achieved the best prediction with RMSE 12.68.},
